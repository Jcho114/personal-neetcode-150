# Personal Neetcode 150
## Motivation
#### I solved many NeetCode questions over the past year; however, I never really took the time to document and save my answers in a structured manner. To avoid this mistake, I created this repository and chose to start over again, since I'm quite rusty, lmao. Hopefully things go well here, so yeah, let's see what happens in a year or so.
